# Vite App Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Vite app from a GitHub repository. Vite is a build tool for web development that is fast and efficient.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Vite app from this repository:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:

   You can either clone this repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it to your preferred location on your local machine.

   To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:farseenmanekhan1232/muted-news-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Change your current working directory to the project folder:

   ```shell
   cd muted-news-assignment
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This command will download and install all the required packages and dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will build and serve the Vite app locally. By default, the development server runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

5. **Access the App**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access your Vite app. You should see your app running.

## Additional Configuration

If you need to customize the configuration of your Vite app, you can refer to the Vite documentation for more details: [Vite Configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Building for Production

When you are ready to build your Vite app for production, you can use the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of your app in the `dist` directory.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow the standard GitHub flow: fork the repository, create a branch, make your changes, and then create a pull request.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
